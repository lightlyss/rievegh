## Description
Working template of parallax camera in Ren'Py. Realistically you need really high-res
art to make use of this. Note that if you find yourself needing these kinds of mods
on the engine, it may be a better choice to swap to Unity.

## Development
Generated on `Ren'Py 7.3.0.271`. Camera motions are started using
`camera_move(x, y, z, theta, t)`. See `game/script.rpy` for an example.

## Disclaimer
Graphical assets used for this demo belong to Centicerise Productions, you can
find their game Fallstreak on Steam. Parallax camera from Alice in Dissonance's
Fault series, written by Akakyouryuu.
