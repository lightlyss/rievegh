## Description
Working template of parallax camera and Live2D plugins in Ren'Py. You probably need
really high-res art to make use of the camera. The Live2D coupling is fairly experimental.
Note that if you find yourself needing these kinds of mods on the engine, it may
be a better choice to swap to Unity.

## Development
Tested on `Ren'Py 7.3.0.271` under Windows 7. Camera should work fine everywhere.
Live2D may work on OSX. See `game/script-*.rpy` for examples. You can run `make clean`
to remove cached files during development but you probably won't need to.
